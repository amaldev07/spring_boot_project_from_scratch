Creating a Spring Boot project involves several steps, including setting up your development environment, creating the project, and configuring dependencies. Since you mentioned you don't have anything installed on your PC, I'll guide you through the process step by step:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework, so you need to have Java installed. Download and install the latest version of the JDK from the official Oracle website or use an alternative like OpenJDK.
Install a Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

While not strictly necessary, using an IDE can greatly simplify development. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio Code (with appropriate extensions for Java development).
Install a Build Tool (Optional but Recommended):

You can use Maven or Gradle as build tools to manage your Spring Boot project's dependencies and build process. Both tools are popular and well-documented.
If you choose to use Maven, you'll need to install it.
If you choose Gradle, you can use the Gradle Wrapper that comes with Spring Boot projects, so you don't need to install it separately.
Create a Spring Boot Project:

There are different ways to create a Spring Boot project. You can use Spring Initializr, a web-based tool that generates a project structure with the necessary files and dependencies.
Open your browser and navigate to Spring Initializr.
Select the desired Spring Boot version, project metadata (such as group and artifact names), and dependencies. At a minimum, you'll need the "Spring Web" dependency.
Click the "Generate" button to download a ZIP file containing your project's initial setup.
Import the Project into your IDE:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
Open your IDE and import the project using its specific instructions. For IntelliJ IDEA, you can choose "Import Project" and select the project's root directory.
Develop Your Spring Boot Application:

Start coding your Spring Boot application within your chosen IDE. Create controllers, services, and other components as needed.
Run Your Application:

You can run your Spring Boot application from your IDE by finding and running the main class with the main method.
Alternatively, you can use the command-line interface of your build tool (Maven or Gradle) to run your application.
Remember that Spring Boot projects often rely on configuration files like application.properties or application.yml. You can find these files in your project's resources directory.

This is a high-level overview of the steps you need to follow to create a Spring Boot project. Depending on your familiarity with Java development, IDEs, and build tools, you may need to explore further resources to get a better understanding of each step. The official Spring Boot documentation is a fantastic resource for in-depth information and guides on various aspects of Spring Boot development.
